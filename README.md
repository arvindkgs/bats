Post-Resizing, we need to validate whether all the configuration files and properties and VM arguments where updated successfully. The series of steps mentioned here - http://aseng-wiki.us.oracle.com/asengwiki/display/~rakesh_rishav/Resizing+tool+Setup+Steps needs to be performed to validate that the resizing script completed successfully. Now manual checking can lead to misses. This is where the tool can be used to do all the checks to verify the success of Resizing.

It takes an input 'metadata' json passed to it as a command-line argument.
